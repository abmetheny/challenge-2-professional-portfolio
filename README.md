# challenge-2-professional-portfolio
Repository containing a professional portfolio to practice Rutger's Coding Bootcamp Module 2 HTML and CSS skills as well as showcase completed work. 

## User Story
AS AN employer  
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples  
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position  

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work  
WHEN I load their portfolio  
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them  
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation  
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section  
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work  
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications  
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application  
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others  
WHEN I click on the images of the applications  
THEN I am taken to that deployed application  
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices  
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
